                                    L&G website to showcase all 20 unique office buildings. It also must feature all L&G-owned work buildings with their branding and [if available] 
                                    microsites attached.                                 </li>

                    This website needs to clearly and concisely showcase the capabilities of the workspaces to attract partners and investors in the future while 
                    also generating leads for the offices themselves. Essentially the purpose of the new proposition website is to provide a clear and effective shop 
                    window for the L&G Office proposition to sell occupiers.

            <b> Homepage filters </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the first identified high severities pain points discovered through our miro session with property managers and in our current occupier's interviews was the users needed an easy way to search on most workspace properties websites to screen if L&G properties met their needs. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Property managers noted that they received a lot of inquiries that didn't fit the needs of an inquirer which lost them their lead to rent the space.
            The homepage filters make sure that this flow would be quick and easy for a user to provide imidate feedback in each step of the user's searching process. In a sense they 'filter' what they want in a property before even having to leave the home page.
            <br />
            <br />
            These filters are sticky and follow a user from the moment they land on the L&G workspace website all through the homepage so the user has the option to scroll down the homepage to learn more. Once the filter is clicked the pre-saved options are available and will take the user straight to the pre-filtered properties page for the user to continue their search.

          <p class="mb-3"><b>Sidebar featured properties scroll</b></p>
          <p class="align-center">
            To continue to alleviate the pain point identified above a sidebar scroll featuring key properties was added to the homepage. The use case for the sidebar scroll is to allow users to see properties available on L&G without having to navigate to a formal property search page. 
            <br />
            <br />
            These feature properties state the location above the image, the name of the property and an eco icon to indicate that a property has a sustainable initiative available.
            The properties sidebar scroll showcases multiple offerings that a property might have which was defined as an epic for being able to prioritise environmental sustainability and green initiatives when searching for an office space.

            Simplicity wasn't the only challenge when creating a unique yet authentic requirement process page. Making the page feel approachable aligns with Nestlé's goal to attract the best talent for good. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The page had to convey authenticity using fun illustrations that celebrate the process and invite future applicants to track their journey using a scrollable line animation. The goal of the page was always to inform an applicant while making the job seeker comfortable with Nestlé's values and brand.  
            'tips' section to ensure this process feels reciprocal, presenting what Nestle expects and ensuring any applicant is the right fit.

                <b>UX writing</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Real estate and Investment are two industries that are full of in-industry terminology. While speaking to stakeholders and property managers during our many sessions of interviews, I realised that the content provided needed UX writing to create an intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly experience while on the website. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Industry acronyms introduce additional cognitive load as users may need to pause and decipher unfamiliar terms, potentially disrupting their flow and hindering their user experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                I needed phrases that avoided industry acronyms to facilitate easier internationalisation and localisation efforts, as it minimizes the need for extensive translation and adaptation of specialised terms.
                By using clear and universally understandable language, L&G workspace can cater to diverse audiences more effectively.

                    Legal and general workspaces will have an ongoing managed service contact in which analytics will be monitored. In the meantime, property asset sites are currently being built to match the look and feel of the main property website to continue continuity under one L&G.
